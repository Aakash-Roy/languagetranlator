# Language Tranlator with Python using Tkinter and Googletrans
An interface for all your tranlations needs

## Inspiration
While traveling language can be a biggest barrier, finding meaning of sentence or word could be difficult. If you know a word meaning but don't know how to write it. That time we go for a translator. The idea behind this language translator to communicate with peers. It makes it easy to communicate with someone who doesn't know our language.

## What it does

It asks the user to typr a word and its language also it asks for output language in which you want it to get translated. For example, I typed Hello and selected its language English and I want it to be translated it spanish so I selected output language spanish. When I click translate button, it will show output Hola.

## How I built it

I built it with Python in which I used tkinter, a well known python library which is used as GUI toolkit also I used googletrans whuch works on Google Translate API.

## What's next for Language Translator with Python

Development is what a programmer do, I will do speech to text and text to speech in this project.
